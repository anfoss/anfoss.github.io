X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a process that equalizes X-linked gene dosage in female organisms. This process is triggered by Xist, a long non-coding RNA that coats one X-chromosome, leading to transcriptional silencing. The spreading of Xist establishes the heterochromatin territory via loss of euchromatin markers and by Polycomb-group proteins recruitment. Recently, several proteins have been described to be involved in XCI however, understanding on how this proteins organize to facilitate Xist-mediated chromosome silencing is still missing.


We aimed to characterize the molecular mechanism linking the Notch co-repressor protein Spen to XCI and to functionally evaluate the dynamics of Spen associated protein complexes upon mammalian dosage compensation.


Here we show that Spen interacts with PRC2 by forming a stable complex which can be SEC-resolved. Spen regulates PRC2 recruitment to chromatin and reduces histone PTMs associated with PRC2, which leads to the assumption that Spen acts as a regulator of PRC2 stability in ES cells.
