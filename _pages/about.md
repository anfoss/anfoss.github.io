## Hi I'm Andrea

I am a wannabe computational biologist working as PhD student in the Aebersold group at ETH Zurich Institute of Molecular System biology.

I am interested in increase our understanding on the principles underlying epigenetic remodelling and cell fate commitment in the context of human diseases.

Because cells are complex systems, traditional reductionistic approaches have fallen short in explaining complex biological processes. Answering these questions require not only several layers of information, but also novel bioinformatic solutions to integrate these heterogenous data sources.


To tackle this issue, I use machine learning and modelling approaches that allow exploration of the data in novel ways and provide deeper understanding of the question of interest.

**Functional interaction proteomics**

I like to think about cells and molecular systems as a social network, where every protein is connected either directly (interaction) or indirectly (signalling) with many more others. This network is clearly more complex than just having a list of all registered users. Ideally, being able to answer questions like _which proteins are friends?_  and _where does this group of friends meet?_ would greatly increased our knowledge on the genotype-phenotype relationship.

**Towards next-generation interactomics**


During my PhD in the Aebersold group I have been involved into development of next-generation interactomics technologies such as size-exclusion chromatography SWATH mass spectrometry _(SEC-SWATH)_. This technique allows for system-wide protein-protein interaction mapping and to obtain description of modularity and stoichiometry thanks to the inherent quantitative nature of data-independent acquisition. However, data analysis for this type of data is cumbersome and relies heavily on prior knowledge. To advance this I developed [PCprophet](https://fossatia.github.io/portfolio/pcprophet/), the first tool  for protein complex prediction directly from co-elution data and then expand it to the differential analysis of multiple conditions.
