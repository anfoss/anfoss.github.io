I am a PhD student in System Biology at ETH Zurich developing next generation interactomics technologies. I provided the first tools for complex-centric prediction of novel protein complexes. I've been programming since high school and spend my extra time working on a selection of projects to improve my current skill-set. 3+ years of experience in mass spectrometry based proteomics. Proficient in data mining, network analysis and statistical modeling.


## Software skills

+ __Languages__ : Python, R, Perl, C++, Bash

+ __ML/Deep learning__ : Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras

+ __MS data analysis__ MaxQuant, Mascot, Trans Proteomic Pipeline, OpenSwath, Spectronaut, Skyline


## Research Experience

#### Institute of Molecular System Biology (2017-2020)
*Supervisors: Ruedi Aebersold, Matthias Gstaiger*

I did my PhD in the Aebersold lab at ETH Zurich, where I investigated the mechanism of mammalian dosage compensation using mass spectrometry based proteomics. I developed software tools for protein complex and protein interaction prediction from co-fractionation data.


#### Institute of Molecular Biochemistry and Biophysics (2016-2017)
*Supervisor: Roman Zubarev*

I have been a research assistant in the Zubarev group at Karolinska Institute where I was working on rheumatoid arthritis. Here I developed a ion scoring algorithm for identification of citrullinated peptides from lung patient biopsies.

#### Department of Analytical Chemistry (2014)
*Supervisor: Maria Careri*

As undegraduate I performed by bachelor thesis in the Careri group at the University of Parma where I worked on development and optimization of multiple reaction monitoring methods for detection of neurotoxins

## Teaching and mentoring

I have been teaching proteomics and computational biology during my PhD at both undergraduate and graduate level.
See [teaching](https://anfoss.github.io/teaching/) page for details on courses and topics.
In addition I supervised 2 master students (9 months each) and 1 semester student (3 months).
