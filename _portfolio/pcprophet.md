[PCprophet](https://github.com/anfoss/PCprophet) is a software toolkit for analysis of co-fractionation MS datasets.
This tool employs a combination of statically validated complexes from available public resources and data-driven de novo complex discovery.
The core idea is that through machine learning the co-elution profile for annotated complexes can be learned and then applied to data-driven hypotheses while controlling the false discovery rate with the database hits, thereby combining the benefits of rigorous error control and the chance of de novo complex discovery.
